# UV-cubesat

The ultraviolet cubesat is a feasibility study contributing towards the ultraviolet astronomy research.  

This research was part conducted at University College Dublin under the supervision of Dr.Morgan Fraser.

Repository consists of various jupyter notebooks used for the different calcultions of a ultraviolet cubesat during the course of the research.

Jupyter notebook for the sensitivity calculations is in the 'Cubesat Sensitivity.ipynb' file which is built on the open soucre Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) of the CASTOR mission. This code enables to enter customised passband filters, aperture diameter and pixel scale
