# UV-cubesat

The ultraviolet cubesat is an early stage feasibility study that would contribute towards the ultraviolet astronomy research.  

This research was part of my masters programme in Space Science and Technology at University College Dublin for the academic year 2021-2022.

Repository consists of various jupyter notebooks used for the different calcultions of a ultraviolet cubesat during the course of the research.

Jupyter notebook for the sensitivity calculations is in the 'Cubesat Sensitivity.ipynb' file which is built on the open soucre Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) of the CASTOR mission. This code enables to enter customised passband filters, aperture diameter and pixel scale
